The challenge here is to utilize the Weather API to collect and analyze weather data from random cities which is done in the WeatherPy notebook. Then find some places with great weather and pin them on the map with the hotel name which is the focus of the VacationPy notebook. 

So how exactly do certain weather conditions vary with latitude? And where should you go on vacation? (Results may vary, I am not liable for your bad vacation decisions.)
